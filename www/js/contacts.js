     *  This plugin maintains an internal copy of the system contacts database. The

     *  initialized from the system database before getContactList() or getContactData() is
     *  called. That initialization can occur explicitly with a call to this getContacts(), or
     *  implicitly with a successful call to addContact(), removeContact(), chooseContact(), or
     *  editContact().
     *
     *  Events fired:

	 *      access the system contacts database. The internal list has not been initialized.
